## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 6, part-2

I like this lab because I have played Blackjack my whole life and the purpose of the lab was to calculate your hand. Sometimes with a big enough hand it can be annoying to keep track. A program like this is helpful and overall fun to play with. It was a good practice on how to use the bool tool. 

Lab 10, part-1

This lab was a good practice on identifying rows and columns. We had to identify counties and their population. It was a complicated loop to make and go through the columns but once we figured it out all went well. 

Lab 1, part-1

This is my most memorable lab because we knew almost nothing. We didnâ€™t know how to save files or how to test or push them to github. Lab 1 was a good introduction to the process we used all semester to start and finish our labs.
